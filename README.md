## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated (SSG) web applications.
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/): Authentication library for Next.js applications, supporting various authentication providers.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Utility-first CSS framework for styling web applications.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): NoSQL database for storing user data and session information.



## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishkarsh25/NEXTJS-Auth.js.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```
   Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to checkout.
   

3. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
